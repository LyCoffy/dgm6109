        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>  
        <p>
            How do my emotions shift from morning to night over time?  
            Is my social life conected to my mood pattern?
        </p>

        <h2>Elements</h2>  
        <p>
            Just like a real string of lights, each bulb represents a day.  
            The wire is the timeline, and the colors reflect how I felt.  
            It's a playful and emotional way to show the ups and downs of the month.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern</h2>  
        <p>
            At a first glance it doesn't look like there's a strong pattern.  
            But when looking at the days of the week, something interesting appears:  
            Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to have the lowest vibes compared to the rest.  
            It's a detail I didn't expect to notice until I look closely.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Chose This?</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to create something fun and festive, inspired by decorative string lights.  
            It felt fitting for the mood-tracking project and honestly made me happy  
            when the visualization finally started to look like an actual light installation.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>Morning bulbs = how the day began</p>
        <p>Night bulbs = how the day ended</p>
        <p>Colour = mood intensity (1–5)</p>
