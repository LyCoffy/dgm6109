/* ----------------------------
I chose the conditional if, because it makes more sence and is easier to me to understand 
as to wether is going to be one or the other. At least at the moment to see it inside the code.
With the word else it seems like is doin another different thing.
As a beginner in js it just makes more sense to me to look up at it this way.
