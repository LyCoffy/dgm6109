        <h2>Question</h2>  
        <p>
            How do my emotions shift from morning to night over time?  
            Is my social life conected to my mood pattern?
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I collected this data for this project because this was something new I was experiencing. 
            My daily habits changed when I got some new friends that I've been fond of these last few months, 
            and I wanted to track the time I spend with them and see how beneficial or perjudicial it was for me 
            to talk to them this often. I also wanted to see how much time I was now spending on my hobbies, 
            especially drawing and taking pictures.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also found it relevant to track my mood changes at the beginning of the day and at the end. 
            I chose to recolect my moods manually by writing them down directly into my data or sometimes on a piece of paper. 
            The rest of the data was taken from other sources: the <code>timeWithFriends</code> value was stored through screen time apps, 
            and the <code>picturesTaken</code> value was taken directly from my camera roll by checking how many pictures I had actually taken.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is an example of the format I started to store my data in. Fortunately, you taught us how to make it readable 
            for the type of code we were using. Instead of adding extra steps in my code, I tried not to complicate it even more 
            and also stored my data chronologically so I wouldn’t have to sort it later in JavaScript:
        </p>

        <pre><code>{
            date: "2025-10-04",
            timeWithFriends: 120, // minutes
            drawingTime: 80, // minutes
            picturesTaken: 0,
            emotionalState: { morning: 2, night: 1 }
        },
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            This is how it ended after cleaning the structure for the final visualization:
        </p>

        <pre><code>{
            "date": "Dec 10, 2025",
            "timeWithFriends": 27,
            "drawingTime": 0,
            "picturesTaken": 0,
            "mood": [3, 4]
        }
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            I ended up with 68 days of data. It was enough to start seeing patterns and tendencies. At a simple glance, 
            you cannot clearly identify them, but with closer inspection I realized my most overwhelming days were 
            Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, most likely the days when I needed to spend more time on homework deliveries. 
            For this, I had to really pay attention and look back at my calendar, but it was interesting to see that 
            this is correctly represented in the visualization.
        </p>

        <p>
            The colours I chose for these emotions are based on simple associations: green is often perceived as positive 
            and red as negative, so they sit at opposite ends of the scale. The blue colour, although it doesn’t completely 
            match the rest of the palette I was going for, felt important to include because blue is often related to relaxation. 
            And most important of all, I chose these colours because of the Christmas theme of the project and the idea of festive lights.
        </p>


       <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The pattern in my visualization was honestly a revelation. I didn’t know something like that was going to appear in my data, 
            and I wasn’t expecting it to show so clearly, but I’m glad it did. It helped me understand those frustrating days way better 
            and gave me a new perspective on how my week actually feels in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main question was whether my social life affects my mood, and I think it does. For the most part, my most social days 
            fall on the positive side of my emotions. Even though some social days were still stressful, overall I noticed that having hobbies 
            and talking to people improved my mood a little bit. It doesn’t magically fix everything, but it does help, and now I can actually 
            see that in the data.
        </p>


        <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>Morning bulbs = how my emotional state began that day</p>
        <p>Night bulbs = how my emotional state ended that day</p>
        <p>Colour = mood intensity (1–5)</p>
