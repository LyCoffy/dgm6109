            <h1>PLOT 2: How my social days evolve through time</h1>

            <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>  
            <p>As the days I gathered as data increase, the time I spend with friends also increases. <!-- I change the format of the hypothesis from the sketch to matched how we've been writing them-->
            Days where I take more pictures also seem to match the days that feel more socially active.</p>

            <h2>This was chose because:</h2>
            <p>Although this may seem like one of the simplest ways to visualize data, 
                I think it was important to use the date as one of the axes. 
                There is a lot to learn when you can actually see the passing of time. This plot connects each day with a line, 
                letting me see whether my social time is rising, falling, or staying consistent. 
                The circles add the third value used, the size shows how many pictures I took that day. 
                I can notice which days were not only socially full, but also creatively engaging.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation:</h2>
            <p>I updated the date format in my dataset so d3 could read it easily, instead of doing the whole process with newDate() or d3.timeParse(),
                which was a little intimidating to thing of. So I chose to write the dates in the exact format we were shown in class.
                I then used <code>Array.sort()</code> to make sure the days appear in the correct order along the X-axis. 
                Fitting all the dates was a bit challenging, but it worked out in the end after adjusting the text rotation and spacing.
                A new thing I learned in this plot was the d3.line() generator. The line tool helped me visually track increases and decreases in my social time.
