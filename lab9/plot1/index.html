            <h1>PLOT 1: How my time with friends affects my emotional state at night</h1>

            <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>  
            <p>As time spent with friends increases, my evening emotional state improves.  
            Days with more pictures taken also tend to have calmer evenings.</p>

            <h2>This was chose because:</h2>
            <p>I realized I was missing this specific comparison. I already had a scatterplot focusing on time with friends and my morning mood, 
            but I think is way important how my emotional state is at the end of the day.  
            This plot lets me see much more clearly whether social time is actually helping my emotional state at night.  
            Now that I added a bit more data, some patterns are finally starting to show, but I think I still need more days to understand the full picture.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation:</h2>
            <p>In this visualization I used <code>Array.sort()</code> on the data before drawing the circles, sorting the points by the number of pictures taken. 
            I did something similar in my previous assignment, so it was way easier this time to adapt to what this graph needed (lab8).<br><br>
            Because the size of each point represents how many pictures I took that day, bigger circles can easily cover the smaller ones if the data is drawn in the original order. 
            Sorting the array from largest to smallest makes sure every dot stays visible and nothing gets lost behind the larger shapes. I also added a thin stroke around each circle to improve readability, 
            since this plot uses a grayscale palette and cannot rely on a colorful contrast.</p>
