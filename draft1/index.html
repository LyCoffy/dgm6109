        <h1>Happy Holidays</h1>

        <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>  
        <p>How do my emotions shift from the morning to the night over time, 
        and are there patterns in how my mood changes within one day?</p>

        <h2>Why I choose it?</h2>
        <p>I chose to visualize this as a string-light installation, inspired by festive or decorative string lights. 
        Showing a creative and fun way of displaying the data I've been collected for the past weeks. I really wanted to
        create a little challenge for me and try my best to pull trough, and althought I'm still missing some things, 
        the merely fact that I reache to this point of actually create the visuslization of the string light it makes me
        so happy. Sorry for delivering this incomplete but I focused exclusvely in trying to deliver to this point, it was
        challenging to use the draw and svg to work like this.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>The morning and night moods are placed above and below the wire:</p>
        <p>Morning bulbs = how the day began</p>
        <p>Night bulbs = how the day ended</p>
        <p>Color = mood intensity (1–5)</p>
